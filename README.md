Travel Journal is an innovative mobile application designed to meet the needs of travel enthusiasts. It provides an intuitive and accessible platform that facilitates the discovery and exploration of desired tourist destinations. The application is designed to be user-friendly for a wide range of users, regardless of age or technological experience, from children to seniors.

My contribution to this project:

    Developed the interactive tour guide functionality, allowing users to access maps of cities they intend to visit and providing visual perspectives of their destinations.
    Implemented markers for the most important tourist attractions on the map, along with brief details.
    Integrated functionality for listing points of interest by categories when users interact with the pins on the map.
    Implemented redirection to the chosen restaurant/museum address when a location is selected, facilitating navigation and itinerary planning.
    Contributed to the design and development of the user interface to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

The list of points of interest includes a variety of places, from restaurants, cafes, and bars to museums, playgrounds, and extreme activities. This diversity allows users to personalize their travel experience based on their interests and preferences
